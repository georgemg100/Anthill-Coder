## Introduction

Anthill-Coder is a cutting-edge, chat interface designed to revolutionize software development. Today's Current AI chat interfaces are too unwieldy for most software developers. By leveraging the power of agentic ai, Anthill-Coder can be your own personal development team, allowing you to get your project to production fast.

### The Challenge of Modern AI Chat Interfaces

Current AI chatbots are not optimal for software developers. While popular chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Claude have opened up a world of opportunities, they are still innefficient tools for developing software. Users often have to submit multiple prompts to get the output they are looking for, must copy over large quantities of code to test and then iterate. This process can be not only time-consuming but also emotionally draining.

### Enter Anthill-Coder: Your personal development team

Anthill-Coder steps in as a game-changing solution to these challenges. Anthill-Coder is not just a tool, but a team of agents that tirelessly work together to build your project. With just a single prompt, Anthill will generate and make modifications to your project across a large number of files, allowing you to be the tech lead and focus on more interesting challenges.

## Features
1. **Starting Objectives**
   - Tell Antill what you would like to build
   - Anthill will decide how many agents to spawn to complete the goal
   - Each agent will see your objective and coordinate tasks with each other
   - The completed project will be saved to output/generated_artifacts
2. **New Objectives**
    - Tell Anthill what you would like to modify in your project
    - Anthill will find the relevant files and coordinate changes across each file
3. **Constraints**
    - Constraints are optional and allow you to set limits on what each agent can do. 
4. **Tracking changes**
    - Anthill will also track any manual changes that you make to the generated project, and will keep these in mind when iterating new changes.
5. **Feedback**
    - Anthill provides realtime feedback on its progress in natural language
6. **Inference Optimization**
    - Anthill greatest strenth is its ability to optimize inference per token. By breaking the objective into many smaller tasks, it is able to use smaller context windows per task and therefore achieve a higher rate of inference compared to a single context window chat interface
